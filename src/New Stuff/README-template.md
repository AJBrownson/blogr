## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

Project Start Date: Friday 17th December, 2021
Estimated Project Completion Date: Friday 24th December, 2021

I started with the markup. I put in everything all the while using deque tools to check for accessibility issues that may occur. This stage took me 20 minutes to complete to my satisfaction.

Edit: I actually started this project on Friday but all I did was the markup for the webpage. While doing this, I was thinking of what Layout to use for the CSS and Grid popped into my mind. At this point, I haven't actually used Grid before as I am comfortable with FlexBox for now but you gotta get outta the comfort zone into the wild if you wanna get good at Web Dev and that's what I'm doing. First I go on to W3schools to read about the stuff before I start.

So here goes...

Monday: I've been styling the header section since morning but I'm kinda through now. On to the body...

Tuesday: The time is 2:20 AM WAT and I'm back at it like a bad habit again

Also Tuesday: The time is 1301 hours and I've been trying to make the increment button look like...well, a button but I'm having problems aligning it to look presentable with the rest of the page. I think I would have to remove the button and style the text to look like a button...

Wednesday: I got sick as hell and could not even open my PC to do anything. I think I may just get some rest today and continue tomorrow.

Thursday: I'm back again today and it feels like I've been gone for years. Everything is looking strange and unfamiliar to my eyes. For the tenth time, i'm beginning to doubt my abilty to complete this project with only Vanilla JS. Damn, I gotta get rid of this self-sabotage and get some work done...Is this what is called Imposter Syndrome?...

Friday: It's Christmas Eve and I'm yet to be done with this project. Now I wish I had gone the mobile-first route. Now i gotta go back and do some changes to the code...Just hope it doesn't break my whole code.

Next stage is CSS. The most exciting part of the project
